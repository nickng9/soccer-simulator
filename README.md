# soccer-simulator

This program runs a simulation of a soccer game between two teams. The events and chances of each event occurring are purely randomized.

It involves srand and rand functions to randomize everything about the game, ranging from the number of events that occur to the chances of one team scoring off of
a penalty kick.

The main idea extracted from this project was employing switch cases to avoid excessive and cluttered nested if statements. Additionally, employing a top down 
structure was key to maintaining a clean workflow.
